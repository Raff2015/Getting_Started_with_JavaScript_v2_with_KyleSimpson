/* # Programming Primer (in JS)
This is an exercise to practice basic programming principles.
## Instructions

The code of this exercise can be executed via Node.js or 
or in the console tab of your browser's dev tools.

1. Define an `addFavoriteBook(...)` function that receives
a single parameter, called `bookName`.

2. If the provided `bookName` string does *NOT*
have the word "Great" in it, add it the `favoriteBooks` arrays.

    Hints :
    - `someString.includes(anotherString)` will return `true`
    if `anotherString` is found inside `someString`, or `false`
    */

function addFavoriteBook(bookName) {

    if (bookName = "Great") {

    }
}
